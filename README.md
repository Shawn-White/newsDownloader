A program I made to download the Arizona Republic and NYT front pages from the Newseum website and combine them into one pdf. For my buddy Shawn and his journalism class

## Usage:

If you are using a Windows computer simply run the .exe file included. The program will name the file after whatever your system's date is (example format: 2020-08-23.pdf). Two temporary PDFs will be created for the individual newspapers, but they will be deleted at the end of the program's execution.

File names can not contain / or \0
